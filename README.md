# MNIST
The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology and it's the “Hello World” dataset of computer vision. The dataset consists of 70000 pictures of handwritten digits (60000 training images and 10000 test images) each containing 28 * 28 pixels.

The goal of this notebook is to build a simple neural network to predict digits from handwritten images using Keras (with TensorFlow as the backend).Particularly, I will be using Keras' Functional Model API to build my neural network model.
